Hi, I‚Äôm my name is Andrew Bruce, I am a mechanical engineer working within the medical device industry. I want to learn to code because I love the quick development cycle and open-source philosophy within the world of software. 

Prior to honing in on a specialization, I‚Äôm interested in attaining a general understanding of web and mobile applicaion development and ML. In the end of the day, I want to create tools and experiences that solve problems and bring joy to other people.

Currently learning HTML, CSS and üêç
