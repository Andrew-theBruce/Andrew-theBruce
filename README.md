Hi, I‚Äôm my name is Andrew Bruce, I am a mechanical engineer working within the medical device industry. The quick development cycle and open source philosophy of the SW industry have led me to want to learn how to code.

Prior to honing in on a specialization, I‚Äôm interested in attaining a general understanding of web and mobile applicaion development and ML. In the end of the day, I want to create tools and experiences that solve problems and bring joy to other people.

Currently learning HTML, CSS and üêç
