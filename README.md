- 👋 Hi, I’m my name is Andrew Bruce, I am a mechanical engineer working within the medical device industry. The quick development cycle and open source philosophy of the SW industry have led me to want to learn how to code.
- 👀 I’m interested attaining a general understanding of web and mobile applicaion development. Once the differences and paths are more defined, I'd like to hone in on one to become a competent developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and 🐍
