Hi, I’m my name is Andrew Bruce, I am a mechanical engineer working within the medical device industry. I'm attracted to the open-source philosophy within the SW world and have an interest in building coding literacy for future projects.

In the end of the day, I want to create tools and experiences that solve problems and bring joy to other people.

Currently learning HTML, CSS, JS and 🐍
